# Feudum: The Queen's Army

Provides a simulated command line automa for playing [Feudum: The Queen's Army](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/226846/feudum-queens-army) given one has a physical copy of [Feudum](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163839/feudum).

This was originally written as a cljs script, but that necessitated a command line ClojureScript environment.  It was rewritten to be hosted online.  Thus, once deployed it can be run by anyone visiting its URL.

At the time it was written, [the retail product](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/game/ByltMRPF32/feudum-the-queens-army) had sold out and was no longer available.
